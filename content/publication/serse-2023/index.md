abstract: "Thermal pyrolysis of hydrocarbons is a promising solution for the industrial production of hydrogen and valuable carbon materials. Pyrolysis reactor design and scale up strongly benefit from predictive chemical kinetic models capable to comprehensively describe the reactivity in the gas phase, including the undesirable formation of amorphous carbon (i.e., soot), as well as the solid carbon deposition mechanism. In this work, a methodology for the determination of rate constants of the heterogeneous growth of pyrocarbon deposit by means of theory-based corrections of analogous gas phase reactions is firstly proposed. Specifically, the theoretical methodology is applied to H-abstraction reactions governing the propagation of superficial active sites. Based on these findings, a detailed pyrocarbon deposition model from the literature is revised and coupled to a state-of-the-art model describing the dynamics of species evolution in the gas phase as well as the molecular growth of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and soot. The model is validated with literature experimental data of pyrocarbon formation from light hydrocarbons feedstocks, covering a large set of operating conditions (pressure, temperature, surface over volume ratio). The comprehensive kinetic framework can reproduce the experimental deposition rates as well as the amount of deposited carbon with high fidelity under varying operative conditions. Moreover, kinetic analyses have been performed for assessing the relevant reaction pathways leading to pyrocarbon deposition from propane and methane feedstocks as well as the competition between carbon deposition and amorphous carbon formation."

summary: "This study proposes a method for determining rate constants in the heterogeneous growth of pyrocarbon deposits, utilizing theory-based corrections of analogous gas-phase reactions. Applied to H-abstraction reactions, the methodology informs the revision of a pyrocarbon deposition model, integrated with a state-of-the-art gas-phase dynamics model for species evolution and growth of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and soot. Validated against literature data, the comprehensive kinetic framework accurately predicts pyrocarbon formation under varied operating conditions, offering insights into relevant reaction pathways and the competition between carbon deposition and amorphous carbon formation."
