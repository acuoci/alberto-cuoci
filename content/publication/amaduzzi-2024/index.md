abstract: 'Large Eddy Simulations (LES) of turbulent reacting flows carried out with detailed kinetic mechanisms have a key role for the discovery of the physical and chemical processes occurring in combustion systems, and are essential for the development of efficient, stable, and non-pollutant technologies. Nevertheless, these simulations require a large amount of computational resources, making their utilization for large-scale systems, such as industrial burners and gas turbines, impractical. In this work, we combine state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms and model reduction methods to deliver a fully automated strategy for performing LES with adaptive chemistry. This strategy is based on the Sample-Partitioning Adaptive Chemistry (SPARC) algorithmic procedure, which consists of four steps: the generation of a training dataset, its partitioning in clusters, the generation of a set of reduced chemical mechanisms specifically tailored to each cluster and, lastly, the numerical simulation of the case of interest with adaptive chemistry enabled by an on-the-fly classification of every grid point. The SPARC approach has already been demonstrated to substantially reduce the computational effort of reactive flows simulations. However a non-negligible level of user interventions is needed, upon which the methodâ€™s success critically depend. Therefore, with the goal of boosting the performance of this workflow and minimise the user-specified degrees of freedom, we plug in and exploit the Local Principal Component Analysis augmented with an automated Bayesian-optimised search for optimal clustering solutions, and the Computational Singular Perturbation method with an additional layer of automation based on the Tangential Stretching Rate for minimally-sized reduced mechanisms. We employ a cheap and easy-to-generate 1-dimensional-flames training database and we demonstrate the efficiency, accuracy and robustness of this strategy with an application to LES of the Adelaide Jet in Hot Coflow (AJHC) burner, a turbulent reacting flow exhibiting intense turbulence-chemistry interactions.'

summary: 'This study introduces a novel approach to Large Eddy Simulations (LES) of turbulent reacting flows, crucial for understanding combustion systems. By integrating machine learning and model reduction methods, the Sample-Partitioning Adaptive Chemistry (SPARC) algorithm automates LES with adaptive chemistry. Enhanced with Local Principal Component Analysis and Computational Singular Perturbation, the strategy minimizes user intervention, boosting efficiency. The method's effectiveness is demonstrated in simulating the Adelaide Jet in Hot Coflow (AJHC) burner, showcasing reduced computational effort and robust performance in complex turbulent-reacting flows.'
